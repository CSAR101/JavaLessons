# JavaLessons
Hi, if you are reading this welcome to my Java lesson repo. Here I will be uploading lessons I will be doing as a refresher to the Java language. I studied Java as my first computer language and it has been sometime since I last used it, therefore I am dedicating this repo as a source for me to relearn Java. All of these lessons are done on my free time and are instructed by John Purcell and his online course at Udemy.com. 

Refresher on the Java Language.
